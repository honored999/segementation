# Status

Updated: 2026-09-21

## Current state

- The active feature branch contains standalone 2D PlainConvUNet and H2Former
  model families with explicit model/supervision checkpoint identities.
- Existing H2Former uses single-output supervision; PlainConvUNet supports its
  default deep supervision and a matched single-output mode.
- Independent `h2former_lite_upernet` and `plain_conv_unet_lite_upernet`
  single-output variants are implemented at `53472ae`. Both use the shared
  lightweight PPM/FPN decoder while preserving the baseline model identities.

## Verified capabilities/results

- Fresh main-agent validation: standalone suite `424 passed in 47.67s`; root
  `tests/` suite `26 passed in 6.67s`.
- Independent Level 3 review of `bbe65b5..53472ae` returned PASS with no
  blocking findings.
- Synthetic complexity evidence shows both new decoders have fewer parameters
  than their corresponding baseline decoders. This is engineering evidence,
  not medical-performance evidence.

## Verified constraints

- Dataset501 remains the established DWI-only baseline.
- Preserve the existing patient-level five-fold split and original full-volume
  formal-evaluation semantics.
- Synthetic validation is engineering evidence only.

## Active work

- Lite-UPerNet implementation is accepted. No real-data training, preflight,
  fold evaluation, or formal five-fold OOF evaluation has been run.
